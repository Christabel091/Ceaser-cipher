he Caesar cipher is a simple and historical encryption technique. Let me explain how it works:

What is the Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a certain number of positions down the alphabet. This shift is known as the key.
For example, if the key is 3, then the letter ‘A’ would be replaced by ‘D’, ‘B’ by ‘E’, and so on1.
How to Use the Caesar Cipher:
Start with a plaintext message.
Choose a key (the number of positions to shift each letter).
Replace each letter in the plaintext with the letter that appears after shifting it by the key positions.
Wrap around the alphabet if needed (e.g., ‘Z’ shifted by 1
